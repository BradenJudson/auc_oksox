# auc_oksox
Function to compute and visualize the Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) for spawning salmonids.

Set up function and apply to Sockeye counts at 1) the Lower Okanagan River, and 2) Penticton Channel.

Note that this function estimates the abundance of _O. nerka_, and thus additional biometric data are required to estimate the relative proportions of anadromous Sockeye, non-anadromous Kokanee and their hybrids.
