# auc_oksox
Function to compute and visualize the Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) for spawning salmonids.

/aucs
Set up function and apply to Sockeye counts at 1) the Lower Okanagan River, and 2) Penticton Channel.

Note that this function estimates the abundance of _O. nerka_, and thus additional biometric data are required to estimate the relative proportions of anadromous Sockeye, non-anadromous Kokanee and their hybrids. These aggregate estimates are then written to their respective subdirectory and processed there. See the following two subfolder descriptions:

1. pen_channel

2. osoyoos
